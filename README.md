# UIResponder-KeyboardAnimation
Showing/dismissing keyboard animation in UIResponder category

This repo is forked and updated from https://github.com/Just-/UIViewController-KeyboardAnimation

As UIViewController-KeyboardAnimation only has a category of UIViewController, but sometimes, we want to show/dismiss keyboard animation in a UIView, so i re-create a category class for UIResponder.
